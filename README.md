# Custom CSS Theme for Jellyfin


This isn't a complete theme but some tweaks and adjustments to make the Jellyfin WebUI more clean, elegant and modern by getting rid of the opinionated ribbons/colors, the detail view junk as well as providing a much nicer backDrop exposure.
I prefer squared shapes so I've decided to get rid of the roundish action buttons as well.

## Installation

Paste this in the General tab of the Jellyfin dashboard:

    @import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RealHollyMolly/custom-jellyfin-theme@main/style.css");
